# ossec-dbd


ossec-dbd has been a part of OSSEC for a long time. It's old and crufty,
and I'm not sure if it actually works.

So I want it gone, and putting it in its own location seems okay. Maybe 
it can get some love here.

The configuration is going to change. I'm tired of xml, and I don't think
it needs to be in the main ossec.conf. The configuration will be simpler
(I hope).
